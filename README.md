===================

This is the front end for the PiMAME remote management site.

##TODO:

- Tidy up redundant code:
  - upload.html template ***(I've left it in for now as it's plugged into a route that is needed for upload to work)***
  - Tidy up templates and partials and concatenate scripts

- Style upload page and upload functionality
- Refresh table view on successful upload and highlight item in table for 2-3 seconds via `.success` class.
- Add automated tests for testing upload feature
- Add delete file feature
- Ignore DS_Store from table file view
